# scripts for JCVI

This repo is used to tentatively deposit some scripts I used in my synteny analysis using JCVI

> why "tentatively"? 
>
> Because I might continue adding new scripts or revising the old scripts.



### (1) within- or between species synteny analysis 

1、we need to create a configure file.

```shell
vim jcvi.config
# species1 species1
# species1 species2
```

As shown above and in this repo, the configure file contains the species you want to explore the synteny relationship.

Each line represents a analysis that conduct within species or between two species, 

e.g. 

- `species1 species1` means run JCVI on its own genome.
- `species1 species2`means run JCVI between species1 and species2.

2. After specified the configure file, now it's time to run the JCVI automatically, not manually.

```shell
sh run_jcvi.sh
```

Finally, there are some matters needing attention: The config file you specified in the `run_jciv.sh`, it should name after the config you created.



### (2) JCVI painting

`jcvi_painting.py` is used to paint the synteny relationships without manually changing the `.simple` file which is created by the JCVI.

1、color config file

for example, there are 12 chromosomes/blocks in the genome you studied and you want to set 12 different colors for the each chromosomes/blocks, you should create a `color config` (this file is tab-delimited) like below:

```shell
1	#fa8072
2	#003153
3	#ffff4d
4	#800080
5	#6495ED
6	#00FFFF
7	#98FB98
8	#7FFF00
9	#808000
10	#FFFACD
11	#FFA500
12	#CD5C5C
```

Then, run the python scripts above,

```shell
python3 jcvi_painting.py --bed species1.bed --config color.config --simple species1.species2.anchors.simple --output new.species1_species2.simple

# save the origin .simple file
mv species1.species2.anchors.simple species1.species2.anchors.simple.back
mv new.species1_species2.simple species1.species2.anchors.simple
# run JCVI macro visualization
python -m jcvi.graphics.karyotype seqids layout
```



### (3) grep gene from two synteny blocks 

There is a graph:

The upper red line represents the chromosome 1 from speciesA, the one below is chromosome 2 from speciesA. 

The blue one in the middle represents the chromosome X from speciesB.

And the black shows the synteny relationships between the chromosomes.

> X is not relevant to the sex chromosome, just a symbol.

`extractblocks.py` is used to extract the gene ID of chromosome1, chromosome2 and chromosomeX which demonstrated the interrelationships between two species.

The usage, 

```shell
python extractblocks.py --help
usage: extractblocks.py [-h] -b1 BED -b2 BED -a  -c1  -c2  -c3  -o1  -o2  -o3

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b1 BED, --species1 BED
                        Unique BED file of speciesA generated by JCVI
  -b2 BED, --species2 BED
                        Unique BED file of speciesB generated by JCVI
  -a , --anchors        .anchors file generated by JCVI
  -c1 , --chromosome1   Set the one chromosome of speciesA
  -c2 , --chromosome2   Set the another one chromosome of speciesA
  -c3 , --chromosome3   Set the one chromosome of speciesB
  -o1 , --output1       Set the output name of gene ID list of speciesA chromosome1
  -o2 , --output2       Set the output name of gene ID list of speciesA chromosome2
  -o3 , --output3       Set the output name of gene ID list of speciesB chromosome3
```
